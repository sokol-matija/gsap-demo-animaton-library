# GSAP Animation Playground

This project is a comprehensive playground for learning and experimenting with GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) animations. It includes examples of various animation techniques and features that GSAP offers.

## Features

The playground includes the following animation sections:

### 1. Basic Animations
- Simple animations like fade, move, and rotate
- Control buttons to trigger animations
- Reset functionality

### 2. Timeline Animations
- Demonstrates GSAP's powerful timeline feature
- Shows how to sequence and overlap animations
- Includes play and reverse controls

### 3. Text Animations
- Character-by-character animations
- Word-by-word animations
- Uses GSAP's SplitText plugin

### 4. SVG Morphing
- Demonstrates how to animate SVG paths
- Morph between different shapes (square, circle, star)
- Smooth transitions with different easing functions

### 5. Draggable Elements
- Interactive draggable elements using GSAP's Draggable
- Bounds constraints to keep elements in container
- Throwing functionality that can be toggled on/off
- Reset positions button

### 6. Scroll Animations
- Animations triggered by scrolling
- Uses GSAP's ScrollTrigger plugin
- Elements animate as they enter the viewport

## How to Use

1. Navigate through the different sections using the navigation buttons at the top
2. Click the control buttons in each section to trigger animations
3. Experiment with the code to create your own animations
4. Use this as a reference for implementing GSAP in your own projects

## GSAP Plugins Used

- Core GSAP library
- ScrollTrigger
- SplitText
- Draggable
